## Introduction

This is a command line interface application that uses Python and requests with the Reddit API. The user can search for a subreddit of their choice and view comments, upvotes, downvotes and what's hot/new/top.

## Initialization

In root folder--

```
python main.py
```

## Functionality

The user is asked in the command line to enter the subreddit they are looking for and then to browse the hot/new/top selections. The user is then presented with the top 20 of those search results and then can view the comments under that post. There is also the description, content, author and upvotes/downvotes for the post. The application uses Colorama to make the interface more attractive to use.
